  Hello, and welcome to my site!
  
  I am a PhD Candidate at Lund University located in the charming city of Lund, Sweden. My research interests include financing frictions, firm investment decisions, econometrics, and data science.  I regularly give lectures in Corporate Valuation in various master's programs and enjoy teaching in Corporate Finance. I am also an avid R user and love finding new solutions to old problems - whether that is in the classroom, in research, or in the industry.
  
   Additionally, I work as a Research Engineer along side a great team in the Active Aging Research Group at Lund's Faculty of Medicine where, among many projects, we examine the relationship between housing choices, health, and active aging using 30 years of register data for over 5 million individuals.  
   
   My personal interests include cycling, hiking, good coffee, and early jazz recordings.
