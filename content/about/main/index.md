  Hello, and welcome to my site!
  
  I am a PhD Canidate at Lund University located in the charming city of Lund, Sweden. My research interests include financing frictions, firm investment decisions, econometrics, and data science.  I am an avid R user and love finding new solutions to old problems.
  
   Outside of corportate finance, my personal interests include cycling, hiking, good coffee, and early jazz recordings.
