<p>Last week I read a paper: “Weathering cash flow shocks” by Brown et al. (2021) which cleverly used unexpected severe winter weather as a setting to examine shocks to firm cash flow and the effect these cash flow shocks have on utilizing and increasing credit lines.</p>
<p>The authors scrape decades worth of publicly available weather station data from across the United States to identify abnormal snow cover in counties where firm headquarters are located.
They use this data to identify exogenous shocks to cash flow and subsequently test behavior related to external finance access. Neat!</p>
<p>My first thought when reading this was: “I wonder if there is an R package for getting this weather data?”</p>
<p>What do you know, there is!
Two in fact!</p>
<p>I first took a look at the <strong>rnoaa</strong> package available on CRAN,
and after spending some time with it I concluded it was a little tricky to navigate and the documentation left a little to be desired.</p>
<p>I then stumbled upon the interesting <strong>FluMoDL</strong> package,
which has a focus on implementing methods to estimate influenza-attributable mortality.
That sounds like absolutely nothing to do with weather station data,
but just wait.</p>
<p>A primary input in these influenza-mortality models turns out to be daily mean temperature for the region in focus.
The authors bundled up some functions that efficiently access and return weather station data from NOAA.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works.
the function <strong>NOAA_getGSOD</strong> will download daily weather summaries for a set of weather stations for a given set of years.
First,
we will need to get a list of stations.
<strong>FluMoDL</strong> has two functions to do this,
<strong>NOAA_allStations</strong>,
which returns a list of all available stations,
and <strong>NOAA_countryStations</strong> which downloads a list of stations located in a particular country.
We’ll be be using the latter to grab some Swedish weather data.</p>

<p>Notice is that <strong>NOAA_countryStations</strong> returns the latitude and longitude of the stations,
data which we could use to make some nice maps,
more on that later.
Also,
it appears the variable <strong>end</strong> contains dates outside of our range,
this could be an error of some sort,
but we’ll fix this below.</p>
<p>We’ll limit our scope and pull data for the first 20 weather stations,
using <strong>head(20)</strong> to return the first 20 observations of <strong>station_list_sw</strong>.
As we are pulling daily weather data,
we’ll stick to a relatively small amount of data for this exercise,
but it should give you an idea of what is possible with <strong>FluMoDL</strong>.</p>
<p>First,
we filter out observations with years below 2020 leveraging the <strong>year</strong> function in <strong>lubridate</strong>.
Then we will pass the object to <strong>NOAA_getGSOD</strong>,
along with a year range, just 2021 in this case,
and a few options to download some data:
<strong>match.columns = “station.name”</strong> to include a vector of stations names in the output,
and <strong>progress = TRUE</strong> to include a progress bar on the download.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stations_sw &lt;- station_list_sw %&gt;%
  filter(year(end) &gt;= 2021) %&gt;% 
  head(20)


df_station &lt;- NOAA_getGSOD(stations_sw,
                    years = 2021,
                    match.columns = &quot;station.name&quot;,
                    progress = TRUE)

<p>Here’s a peak at what the data look like.</p>

<p>We can now merge the weather data with the station data and some some quick tidying to get a nice final data set to work with.
We will take advantage of the pipe and dplyr’s excellent data cleaning functions,
coupled with <strong>group_by</strong> and <strong>summarise</strong> to get a monthly average temperature by station.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_weather_sw &lt;- df_station %&gt;% 
  left_join(station_list_sw,
            by = &quot;station.name&quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(date, station.name, temp, lat, lon) %&gt;% 
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(station.name, month) %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(temp),
            lat = lat,
            lon = lon)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>theme_set(theme_light())

rand_station &lt;- df_weather_sw %&gt;% # Select 5 random stations from df
  group_by(station.name) %&gt;% 
  summarise() %&gt;% 
  sample_n(5) 

df_weather_sw %&gt;%
  filter(station.name %in% rand_station$station.name) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = mean_temp, fill = station.name)) +
  geom_bar(position=&quot;dodge&quot;, stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;Average temp of Swedish weather stations in 2021&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Five random stations&quot;,
       x = &quot;Month&quot;,
       y = &quot;Avg Temp in C&quot;,
       fill = &quot;Station name&quot;) + 
  theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="staion_temp.jpg" /></p>
<p>While we’re at it,
we can load the <strong>sf</strong> and <strong>rnaturalearth</strong> packages to quickly plot the location of the weather stations we downloaded on a map.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)


world &lt;- ne_countries(scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;)

ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data = df_weather_sw, aes(x = lon, y = lat), size = 2, 
             shape = 23, fill = &quot;darkred&quot;)+
  coord_sf(xlim = c(1,30), ylim = c(55,72), expand = TRUE) +
  labs(title = &quot;Location of weather stations in Sweden&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;First 20 stations from our download&quot;,
       x = &quot;Longitude&quot;,
       y = &quot;Latitude&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="staion_map.jpg" />
We could do some more fancy plotting with geographical data,
but I think I’ll save that for another post.</p>
<p>Happy weather plotting!</p>
